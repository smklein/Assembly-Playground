# Assembly-Playground

This is my attempt at creating an interpreter for x86 assembly commands.
Ideally, it could be eventually expanded to other ISAs, as well as x86-64.

WARNING:
I realize that most half-decent software project try to abide by an
odd concept known as "good design". That is not something I am actively doing
here. Rather, this is a playground for two reasons. Firstly, it should
(ideally) allow users to play with assembly. Secondly, it's MY playground,
where I throw hacks at the wall and see what breaks. Use (and peruse) at
your own risk.

Currently unfinished and buggy. It's a work in progress. Even if that
progress is slow, and whenever I'm on holiday.
